About the project-
Step 1: Created account on omega (srn3489) and set up the credentials
Step 2: Executed create table statements for each table. Applied all the necessary constraints while creating the table. This execution was done using putty which helped us capture the spool file for the same.
Step 3: Using Python we inserted the initial records as provided. In this step to avoid circular referencing, initially some records were inserted as NULL for some of their foreign keys and then those were updated later.
Step 4: Then using putty, we proceeded with executing item 4 followed by item 3. 
Step 5: Finally we execute question 5,6 & 7 in that order
